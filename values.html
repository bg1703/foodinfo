The scientific principles of feeding have long been applied to domestic animals. Agricultural papers discuss the diets of cattle, and tell what foods and how much are required to produce a 150-pound calf or to support a working horse. The same principles may be applied to produce a 150-pound boy who has the natural vigor and grace of a healthy calf, or to maintain a workingman with the strength and activity of a sleek working horse. Feeding human beings is becoming an exact science, whose elementary principles are few and may be readily understood. Writings on human diets are often bare statements of advice like dogmatic rules in arithmetic without explanations of the reasoning on which the rules are founded. When the foundation principles of dieting are understood, an intelligent person can apply them in the choice of food and the manner of feeding. It is necessary that a health officer should know and understand the scientific basis of food values, for nutrition has a direct bearing on physical and mental vigor, and on immunity to diseases.

Food substances are divided into three classes:
<br>
<ol type=1>
<li>Building foods.
<li>Fuel foods.
<li>Regulative foods

Building Foods
</b>
</font>
<br>Every kind of living matter consists of a mixture of protein, water, and minerals. These three substances compose the flesh, blood, and bone of the human body. Building foods are required for two purposes for growth and for the repair of worn-out parts.
<br>
Protein consists of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, together with nitrogen and sulphur. It is a complex substance, and exists in various forms in the human body. Examples of protein are lean meat and the white of an egg. The body needs about 3 ounces of protein daily.
<br>
Minerals are the ashes that are left after a substance is burned. They consist of such material as lime, soda, potash, and iron. They are found in nearly all kinds of foods, and are intimately joined to the proteins in organic combinations. Minerals added to food cannot take the place of those which are naturally there. We usually get sufficient mineral-building material when we eat the proper amount of other substances. They also have important uses as regulative foods.
<br>
Water enters and leaves the body unchanged in its form or composition. Its quantity in the flesh or blood may vary considerably from time to time. It is a vehicle in which all other body substances are dissolved. There is only one kind of water, and little need be said about it in a discussion of food values.
<br>
Fat is also found in the body, but little or none of it consists of fat that is eaten. It is manufactured principally from protein which the body does not need for other purposes.

Fuel Foods
</b>
</font>
<br>
The food which a grown person takes into his blood in a day would weigh about 1 pound if it were dried, and yet it disappears and the body does not gain in weight. The explanation is that it is burned, or oxidized, in the body. The second great class of foods consist of those which the body uses as fuel. The oxygen which the body uses in oxidizing its fuel food weighs about ½ pound more than the food, excepting water.
<br>
The process of oxidation in the body has two uses: 1, to produce heat for warming the body, and 2, to produce power for doing muscular work. A person doing muscular work burns food rapidly, and becomes warm. The body is a heat engine, and is run by means of the heat of its burning food. Only one-quarter of the total amount of the heat produced by the food can be used in developing power in the body. But the body engine is twice as efficient as the best steam engine, for the steam engine can turn only about one-tenth of its heat into power.
<br>
The fuel foods are starches, sugars, and fats. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, with no nitrogen or sulphur. Starches and sugars are often called carbohydrates. Nearly all the fuel foods are oxidized soon after they enter the body.
<br>
The worn-out parts of the body consist principally of protein which has been oxidized. A grown person needs protein for the purpose of replacing that part of his living flesh which has been oxidized. We may, therefore, call protein a fuel food as well as a building food.

Composition of Foods
</b>
</font>
<br>
Foods may be divided into those derived from animals and those derived from vegetables. Animal foods are rich in protein, and so also are peas and beans. These are popularly called building foods. They usually contain considerable amounts of fat, and are, therefore, fuel foods also. No animal food, except milk, contains carbohydrates in important quantities. Cereals, potatoes, and some fruits have a large proportion of sugar or starch and are, therefore, called fuel foods. But nearly all contain some protein, and are, therefore, to be classified as building foods also. Garden vegetables and the juicy fruits contain little protein or carbohydrates, and their value for building or fuel is small. Their principal value is that they contain regulative substances which are essential to health and growth.
<br>
The value of foods for building or fuel may be estimated from tables of their chemical composition. The tables usually give the proportion of protein, carbohydrate, fat, and mineral matter in the various foods, but they afford little basis for estimating their content of regulative foods. The following table is a general summary of the composition of the various classes of foods:
<font size=5>
Animal Food
</font>
Protein — 10% to 30%
<br>
Fat — 10% to 75%
<br>
Sugar or starch — Practically none.
<br>
Cereals, Potatoes, Beans, Etc.
<br>
Sugar or starch — 5% to 50%
<br>
Protein — 2% to 20%
<br>
Fat — 0% to 10%
<br>
Fruit And Garden Vegetables
<br>
Sugar or starch — 1% to 10%
<br>
Protein — 1% to 5%
<br>
Fat — Practically none.

Oxidation of Food
</font>
<br>
The oxidation of food in the body is similar to the oxidation of wood in a stove. Food unites with oxygen in the body, and becomes smoke and ashes and produces heat. The oxidation of the carbon of either protein, carbohydrates, or fats produces carbon dioxide, and the oxidation of hydrogen produces water. These are the principal substances in the smoke of a burning fire. Neither of them is harmful to the body unless it is present in excessive quantity. Each is excreted from the body by an easy and simple process.
<br>
The oxidation of the nitrogen and sulphur of protein produces an ash which has an acid reaction. A certain degree of alkalinity of the blood and tissues is necessary for health, and when it is reduced, the body suffers in health and vigor. A diet containing a large proportion of meat, or eggs, or other animal food is harmful on account of the acid ash left after the oxidation of its protein. The excretion of the acids overtaxes the liver and produces what the older physicians called biliousness; and the acids circulating in the blood produce gout, rheumatism, and pains in the joints and muscles. The more remote effects of an excessive protein diet are kidney troubles, hard arteries, and premature old age.
<br>
The ash left by cereals and most other vegetable foods is strongly alkaline, and is beneficial to the body. Its alkalinity is due to the small proportion of protein in the foods, and also to the large proportion of alkaline minerals in them. One of the fundamental principles of dieting is to cat no more protein than is needed to replace the worn-out protein of the living flesh. This may usually be accomplished by eating sparingly of meat and other animal foods, and using cereals and vegetables in their place. Milk and milk products are exceptions to this rule, for they contain protein and alkaline minerals in a proper combination for health.
<br>
We recognize two types of men in the relation of their food to oxidation. A stout man has a large stomach and fuel capacity, and small lungs and oxidizing ability. His stomach can supply fuel faster than his lungs can furnish oxygen to oxidize it. He will be likely to be short of breath and asthmatic, and to have trouble with his liver, kidneys, and arteries. He will probably be benefited by Jiving on coarse, unnutritious food. His stomach can usually extract sufficient nutritive matter from coarse foods, such as spinach, turnips, and cabbage. If he lives on such foods as these, he may safely satisfy his hunger and appetite without exceeding his oxidizing capacity.
<br>
A lean athlete has large lungs and a small stomach. His digestive power is small and is constantly overtaxed in supplying sufficient food to replace that which is oxidized by the large lungs. This man will thrive on a concentrated diet. He can take an excess of protein with little harm, for he can oxidize it well. His worst troubles are likely to be indigestion and dyspepsia.
<br>
The relation of the stomach to the lungs will explain many of the contradictory observations about dieting. The lungs and the oxidizing capacity of the body must always be considered in discussing a person’s food.

Caloric Value
</b>
</font>
<br>
One standard of the value of various foods is the proportion of protein in them; another is their mineral composition; and another is their content of regulative substances; but the standard of the broadest application is their fuel value. The heating capacity of foods is the standard of their value which is usually given in tables of food composition. About nine-tenths of the subject of dieting concerns the fuel value of foods. The body must oxidize a certain amount of fuel food in order to do a given amount of work. These quantities have been determined by observing men who live for days in a closed chamber which is provided with means for analyzing the air, the food, and the excretions, and for measuring the quantity of heat that the man produces and the amount of physical work which he performs. The results may be applied accurately in providing food for armies, exploring expeditions, and institutions. They also give accurate results in feeding individuals.
<br>
The fuel value of a food is found by burning a weighed quantity of dried food in a piece of apparatus called a calorimeter. The case containing the food is surrounded by water. When the amount of food, the quantity of water, and the increase in the temperature of the water are known, the amount of heat produced by a unit of weight of food may be easily calculated.
<br>
Quantities of heat are measured in calories. One calorie is the amount of heat that will raise 1 kilogram of water 1° C. This is nearly the amount that will raise 1 pint of water 1° F.; 100 calories will raise a quart of ice-cold water nearly to the boiling-point; 2500 calories will raise 75 quarts of water, which is nearly the volume of the body, from a freezing temperature to that of the normal body. A person doing light work needs to produce about 2500 calories daily, and one at heavy work, 3500 or 4000 calories.
<br>
The adult human body produces heat at about the same rate as two burning candles of tallow or paraffin. An ordinary candle weighs 1 ounce, will burn four hours, and will produce 240 calories of heat. Two candles burning continuously for twenty-four hours will, therefore, produce 2880 calories of heat.
<br>
<font size=6><b>
Balanced Diet
</b></font>
<br>
The body is designed to oxidize food elements in certain proportions. The protein which it is designed to oxidize is that which forms a part of the living flesh of the muscles. Protein is a poor fuel food, and is oxidized with difficulty. It is also much more expensive than the proper fuel foods—starch, sugar, and fat.
<br>
Fat enters the blood-stream just as the blood is approaching the lungs. Most of the fat is probably oxidized in the lungs. Starch and sugar enter the blood-stream in the intestine, and are carried to the liver. The best health is maintained when oxidation in the muscles, the lungs, and the liver is maintained in the proper balance. A diet containing protein, fat, and carbohydrate in the proper proportions is called a balanced diet. A standard proportion is that one-sixth of the calories shall come from protein, two-sixths from fat, and three-sixths from carbohydrate.
<br>
The effects of an unbalanced diet may be illustrated by candy eating. When an excess of sugar is eaten, oxygen will combine with it more readily than with protein. The protein will then be imperfectly oxidized, and will harm the body in the same manner that an excess of protein in the diet would. The rapid oxidation of alcohol in the body, and its effect in robbing the protein of oxygen, account for many of the evil effects of strong drink.
