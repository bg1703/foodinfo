Animals, specifically humans, have five different types of tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. As animals 
have evolved, the tastes that provide the most energy (sugar and fats) are the most pleasant to eat while others, such 
as bitter, are not enjoyable.Water, while important for survival, has no taste. Fats, on the other hand, 
especially saturated fats, are thicker and rich and are thus considered more enjoyable to eat.

<font size=6>Sweet</font>
<br>
Generally regarded as the most pleasant taste, sweetness is almost always caused by a type of simple sugar such as 
glucose or fructose, or disaccharides such as sucrose, a molecule combining glucose and fructose. Complex carbohydrates 
are long chains and thus do not have the sweet taste. Artificial sweeteners such as sucralose are used to mimic the 
sugar molecule, creating the sensation of sweet, without the calories. Other types of sugar include raw sugar, which 
is known for its amber color, as it is unprocessed. As sugar is vital for energy and survival, the taste of sugar is 
pleasant.

The stevia plant contains a compound known as steviol which, when extracted, has 300 times the sweetness of sugar
 while having minimal impact on blood sugar.

Sour
</font>
<br>
Sourness is caused by the taste of acids, such as vinegar in alcoholic beverages. Sour foods include citrus, specifically 
lemons, limes, and to a lesser degree oranges. Sour is evolutionarily significant as it is a sign for a food that may 
have gone rancid due to bacteria.Many foods, however, are slightly acidic, and help stimulate the taste buds and
enhance flavor.

Salty
</font>
<br>
Saltiness is the taste of alkali metal ions such as sodium and potassium. It is found in almost every food in low to 
moderate proportions to enhance flavor, although to eat pure salt is regarded as highly unpleasant. There are many 
different types of salt, with each having a different degree of saltiness, including sea salt, fleur de sel, kosher 
salt, mined salt, and grey salt. Other than enhancing flavor, its significance is that the body needs and maintains a 
delicate electrolyte balance, which is the kidney's function. Salt may be iodized, meaning iodine has been added to 
it, a necessary nutrient that promotes thyroid function. Some canned foods, notably soups or packaged broths, tend to 
be high in salt as a means of preserving the food longer. Historically salt has long been used as a meat preservative 
as salt promotes water excretion. Similarly, dried foods also promote food safety.

Bitter
</font>
<br>
Bitterness is a sensation often considered unpleasant characterized by having a sharp, pungent taste. Unsweetened 
dark chocolate, caffeine, lemon rind, and some types of fruit are known to be bitter.

Umami
</font>
<br>
Umami, the Japanese word for delicious, is the least known in Western popular culture but has a long tradition in 
Asian cuisine. Umami is the taste of glutamates, especially monosodium glutamate (MSG).It is characterized as 
savory, meaty, and rich in flavor. Salmon and mushrooms are foods high in umami.
